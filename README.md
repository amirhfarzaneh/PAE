## Introduction
Simultaneously running multiple modules is a key requirement for a smart multimedia system for facial applications including face recognition, facial expression understanding, and gender identification. To effectively integrate them, a continual learning approach to learn new tasks without forgetting is introduced. Unlike previous methods growing monotonically in size, our approach maintains the compactness in continual learning. The proposed packing-and-expanding method is effective and easy to implement, which can iteratively shrink and enlarge the model to integrate new functions. Our integrated multitask model can achieve similar accuracy with only 39.9% of the original size.

## [Compacting, Picking and Growing (CPG)](https://github.com/ivclab/CPG)
We enhance our PAE to become the CPG, which is published in NeurIPS, 2019.
